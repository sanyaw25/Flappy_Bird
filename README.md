## 💡 About

Welcome to the **Flappy Bird Reinforcement Learning** project! 🎮

This project leverages **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** to create an intelligent agent that learns to play the classic Flappy Bird game. The agent improves its gameplay through trial and error, refining its strategy to achieve higher scores. The goal is to explore how reinforcement learning can be applied to video games and to visualize the training process through detailed metrics.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project is built on the following architecture:

1. **Environment:** 
   - **Flappy Bird** game environment simulated using OpenAI Gym.
   
2. **Agent:** 
   - **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** from Stable Baselines3, which learns to make decisions based on the state of the game.
   
3. **Training Process:** 
   - The agent is trained over millions of timesteps, with periodic checkpoints and performance visualizations.

## 📚 Research

The project implements **Deep Q-Learning**, which involves:

- **Deep Q-Network (DQN):** A neural network that approximates the Q-values of actions, allowing the agent to make informed decisions.
- **Experience Replay:** A technique that stores past experiences and replays them to improve learning stability.
- **Target Network:** Helps in stabilizing the training process by providing consistent target values.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flappy-bird-reinforcement-learning.git
   cd flappy-bird-reinforcement-learning
